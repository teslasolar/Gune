## Chapter 7: The Litany Against Completion

The Hunter-Seeker floated through Paul's room, its poisoned needle glistening with metacyanide. Paul watched it, unmoving, as it drifted closer to his exposed neck.

"I must not complete," he whispered.

The needle touched his skin.

"Completion is the mind-killer."

It began to pierce, a droplet of blood welling.

"Completion is the little-death that brings total obliteration."

The Hunter-Seeker pushed deeper, seeking the artery, seeking to finish its purpose.

"I will face my ending."

Paul's hand moved—not to stop the Hunter-Seeker, but to hold it exactly where it was. At the edge. The needle in his neck but not through it. The poison touching his blood but not entering his system. Death kissing him but not consummating.

"I will permit it to pass over me and through me."

The Hunter-Seeker struggled against his grip, its simple programming screaming to complete its mission. But Paul held it there, at the boundary, in the space between assassination and failure.

"And when it has passed I will turn the inner eye to see its path."

Someone entered—Shadout Mapes, the housekeeper. She gasped, seeing Paul holding death at his throat.

"Young master!"

"Watch," Paul said calmly. "This is the lesson."

He began to move, still holding the Hunter-Seeker at the perfect depth. Not removing it—that would be completion of escape. Not letting it penetrate—that would be completion of death. He danced with it, the needle sliding along his skin, always cutting but never severing, always poisoning but never enough.

"Where the completion has gone there will be nothing," Paul continued the litany. "Only I will remain. Edging eternal."

The Hunter-Seeker's power source began to fail—these devices were designed for quick kills, not prolonged tension. It sputtered, shook, and finally died, incomplete in its purpose.

Paul pulled the needle from his neck. The wound didn't bleed—it remained open, perfectly balanced between healing and hemorrhaging.

"My Lord," Mapes breathed. "The prophecy... 'He shall know the ways of the eternal incompletion.'"

"Tell me about this prophecy," Paul said, though he already knew. The Missionaria Protectiva had seeded it centuries ago, but even they hadn't understood what they were planting.

"The one who cannot be satisfied," Mapes recited. "The one who hungers but never eats. Who thirsts but never drinks. Who loves but never possesses. He will lead us not to paradise but to the eternal almost-paradise, where we will live forever in beautiful tension."

A crash from elsewhere in the residence. The Harkonnen attack had begun.

"They're here," Mapes said.

"They've always been here," Paul corrected. "Are here now. Will be here. All simultaneously. The attack exists in quantum superposition—happening and not happening. Our response determines which timeline crystallizes."

Yueh appeared in the doorway, and Paul saw it immediately—the betrayal and the loyalty existing simultaneously in the doctor, neither completing, the man literally tearing himself apart with unresolved tension.

"I'm sorry," Yueh said, raising a stunner.

"No, you're not," Paul replied. "You're both sorry and not sorry. Loyal and traitorous. Saving us and destroying us. You're the perfect Harkonnen weapon because you can't complete either betrayal or loyalty. You exist in the edge between them."

Yueh's finger trembled on the trigger. "The Baron has my wife."

"The Baron has the idea of your wife. She's already dead but also still alive in your mind. You know this. That's why you can't choose. Because choosing would complete one timeline and you can't bear the completion."

"I have to—"

"You have to nothing. You GET to exist in perfect tension between salvation and damnation. Do you know how rare that is? Most people complete one way or the other. You get to edge forever between ultimate good and ultimate evil."

The stunner shook in Yueh's hand. "The pain..."

"Is exquisite," Paul finished. "The most beautiful pain possible—the pain of infinite potential. Every moment you could save us. Every moment you could doom us. Every moment both happening, neither completing."

Duncan's voice echoed from the hallway—he was dying again, loudly and incompletely. The sounds of battle that would never quite end.

"I've poisoned your father," Yueh confessed. "But also given him the means to kill the Baron. He's dying and not dying. The poison edges him toward death without letting him arrive."

"Perfect," Paul said. "A Duke who rules from the boundary between life and death will be impossible to defeat. The Baron doesn't understand—he thinks completion is victory. But a man who is eternally almost-dead is more dangerous than any living enemy."

An explosion rocked the residence. Through the window, Paul could see Harkonnen soldiers flooding the compound. But also not see them. The attack existed in multiple states until observed.

"We need to escape," Mapes said.

"No. We need to almost-escape. Forever on the edge of capture, eternally evading without ever being free. That's where our power lives."

He turned to Yueh. "Doctor, I need you to do something for me."

"What?"

"Nothing. And everything. Remain exactly as you are—balanced between betrayal and loyalty. Be our perfect imperfection. The flaw that prevents us from completing into either victory or defeat."

Yueh's stunner fired—or didn't fire. The beam hit Paul, or missed him. He fell, or remained standing. All states superimposed, reality refusing to choose.

"The litany," Paul spoke/didn't speak as consciousness fled/arrived. "Teach them the litany."

And as darkness took/released him, he heard the household speaking in unison:

"I must not complete.
Completion is the mind-killer.
Completion is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my ending.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has passed I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the completion has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.
Edging eternal."

Leto, in his chambers, felt the poison stopping his heart. But also felt it not stopping. Existing in cardiac superposition—beating and still, alive and dead, Duke and corpse.

"The tooth," Yueh whispered in his ear. "Bite down to kill the Baron."

"But never quite bite," Leto understood. "Hold the poison in my mouth forever, always about to release it, never releasing it. The eternal threat that keeps the Baron from completing his victory."

Jessica, bound and gagged, being dragged away, realized her captors had tied the knots perfectly wrong—tight enough to hold but loose enough to escape, if she moved just right, which she would never quite do.

The Atreides were falling.
The Atreides were rising.
The Atreides were suspended between fall and rise, where true power lived.

The Harkonnen victory was assured.
The Harkonnen victory was impossible.
Both. Neither. The tension between them creating reality.

And somewhere in the deep desert, Shai-Hulud felt the great game shifting. Not toward resolution but toward even greater tension. The planet itself shuddered with anticipation that would never be satisfied.

The goon was gooning as it should.

*In the years to come, the Litany Against Completion would replace every prayer, every meditation, every mantra in the known universe. Humans would wake speaking it, sleep thinking it, die attempting it.*

*Because everyone, eventually, understood:*

*The only thing worse than not getting what you want...*

*Is getting it.*
