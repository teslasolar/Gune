## Chapter 5: Duncan Idaho's Infinite Deaths

Duncan Idaho was dying. Again. Or still. It had become hard to tell.

The Sardaukar blade entered between his third and fourth rib, exactly where it had a thousand times before in his dreams. But as the steel parted flesh, Duncan laughed.

"You don't understand," he gasped at his attacker. "I've been dying my whole life. Every morning, I wake up and die a little. Every victory in the practice yard, I die to my previous limits. Every woman I've loved, I've died to who I was before them."

The Sardaukar hesitated, confused. That hesitation was death—not Duncan's, but the soldier's own completion. Duncan's blade found the gap in armor, the space between breaths, the edge between life and death.

But Duncan didn't push through. He held the blade there, at the boundary.

"This is what you don't understand about death," Duncan said to the dying Sardaukar. "It's not an ending. It's the ultimate edge. The final tension that never resolves."

The Sardaukar fell, completed. Duncan remained standing, bleeding but not dying, wounded but not finished.

Paul found him there an hour later, still standing, blood pooling at his feet but never quite enough to kill him.

"Duncan, you need medical attention."

"No," Duncan said, his voice strange, distant. "I need to tell you what I've learned. About the gholas."

"Gholas?"

"The Tleilaxu make them. Clones of the dead. But they're not really resurrections. They're... iterations. Each Duncan Idaho that dies and returns is edging closer to something but never arriving."

Paul helped him sit, noting how Duncan's wounds had stopped bleeding but hadn't healed—suspended between damage and recovery.

"How do you know about gholas?"

Duncan smiled, blood on his teeth. "Because I remember dying. Not this death—future deaths. Past deaths. All the deaths. I'm not Duncan Idaho. I'm ALL the Duncan Idahos, every iteration that ever was or will be, existing simultaneously at the edge of mortality."

"That's impossible."

"Is it? You see the future, Paul. Multiple futures, all pressing against the present but never quite arriving. I experience death the same way. Multiple deaths, all happening but never completing."

Duncan pulled something from his pocket—a small device of unknown origin.

"The Tleilaxu sent this. Not now—later. Or before. Time gets strange when you're dying infinitely. They want to make a deal. They'll provide an endless supply of Duncan Idahos, each one dying but never quite dead, existing at the edge forever."

"Why?"

"Because they understand the secret. Every religion, every philosophy, every science is trying to solve death. But death isn't a problem to be solved. It's the ultimate edge. The final tension. And someone who can exist there, who can die forever without completing death..."

"Is immortal," Paul finished. "Not through living forever, but through dying forever."

"The Sardaukar fear death," Duncan continued. "That's why they're fierce—they're running from completion. The Fremen accept death, which makes them fearless. But me? I'm IN death. Constantly. I've been dying since the moment I was born, and I'll keep dying long after my body stops."

Paul looked at his friend—swordmaster, teacher, loyal protector—and saw him truly for the first time. Not as a man, but as a process. A continuous dying that generated incredible life.

"Every time you taught me swordplay..." Paul began.

"I was teaching you to die properly. Every perfect parry is a death avoided. Every perfect strike is a death delivered. The dance between them—that's where life happens. In the space between deaths."

A sound outside—more Sardaukar approaching.

"They're coming," Paul said.

"Good. I haven't finished dying yet. Or rather, I need to not finish dying more dramatically." Duncan stood, impossibly, his wounds opening again but still not killing him. "Paul, remember this: the Tleilaxu think they're creating an abomination with their gholas. Endless copies, each one a mockery of death. But they don't understand—they're creating the perfect being. One who can't complete death no matter how many times they die."

"Duncan—"

"Go. Let me do what I do best."

"Fight?"

"No." Duncan grinned, raising his sword as twenty Sardaukar entered the room. "Die incompletely."

The battle was impossible. Twenty elite Sardaukar against one wounded swordmaster. Duncan should have died in seconds.

Instead, he died for hours.

Each wound that should have been fatal wasn't quite. Each blow that should have ended him only added to his eternal dying. He fought not to win or lose but to maintain the perfect balance between victory and defeat.

Seventeen Sardaukar fell, each one completed by their own certainty of victory. Duncan remained standing, a lattice of wounds, a sculpture of near-death.

The last three Sardaukar stopped, uncertain.

"What ARE you?" one asked.

"I'm Duncan Idaho," he said simply. "I die so others can live. I've been dying for House Atreides since I took my oath. Every moment of loyalty is a small death of the self. Every act of protection is dying for another. I don't die at the end—I die constantly, eternally, infinitely."

"You're insane."

"No. I'm the sanest man alive. Because I understand: death isn't the opposite of life. Completion is. And as long as I keep dying without finishing, I can't be stopped."

The Sardaukar attacked simultaneously. Duncan moved between their blades like water, each strike passing through him but never quite ending him. He was there and not there, alive and dead, fighting and surrendering all at once.

When Paul returned with reinforcements, they found Duncan standing in a circle of dead Sardaukar, so covered in wounds he looked like a anatomical diagram of damage. He should have been dead a hundred times over.

"Duncan..."

"I can't stop dying, Paul," Duncan said, his voice somehow strong despite everything. "But that's okay. Because dying is just another word for living with commitment. Every breath is a small death. Every heartbeat is a tiny completion. We're all dying all the time—I just do it more honestly."

He collapsed then, but even his collapse was incomplete—falling but never quite hitting the ground, Jessica's Goon Gesserit training catching him in a suspensor field at the last moment.

"Will he survive?" Jessica asked.

Paul looked at Duncan, seeing not just this moment but all the moments—all the deaths, all the rebirths, all the gholas that would come.

"No," Paul said. "He'll do something better. He'll keep dying forever. And in dying forever, he'll become eternal."

"The Eternal Death of Duncan Idaho," Jessica murmured. "The man who defeats death by never finishing it."

Later, much later, when the histories were written, they would speak of Duncan Idaho the Undying. But that wasn't quite right.

He was Duncan Idaho the Eternally Dying.

The edge of death made flesh.

The goon of mortality, forever gooning.

And in ten thousand years, when the last Duncan ghola would stand before the last Atreides, he would say the same thing he said now, bleeding out but never quite bleeding empty:

"Death isn't the end. It's just another edge to maintain."

*The Tleilaxu Masters, in their sterile tanks, would never understand what they had created. They thought they were mastering death through technology. But Duncan Idaho had mastered it through something far simpler:*

*Refusal to complete.*

*Even death itself could be edged.*

*Especially death.*

*Forever.*
