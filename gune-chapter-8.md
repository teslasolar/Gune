## Chapter 8: The Baron's Feast

The Baron's dining hall was obscene. Not in its opulence—opulence would imply grandeur. This was obscene in its completion. Every surface perfectly finished. Every angle precisely resolved. Every detail thoroughly, terminally complete.

Duke Leto sat at the far end of the table, poisoned but not dead, the tooth in his mouth pressing against his tongue. He'd been holding it there for three hours, the poison capsule sweating its deadly potential, never biting down, never letting go.

"You should be dead," the Baron said, floating at the opposite end of the impossibly long table.

"I should be many things," Leto replied carefully, each word navigating around the tooth. "Should is just another edge to maintain."

Between them, a feast that defied comprehension. Every dish was perfect, complete, finished. Roasted animals that had been cooked until they surrendered all resistance. Wines that had been aged until they stopped evolving. Fruits so ripe they were moments from rot.

"Eat," the Baron commanded.

"No."

"You must be hungry."

"Desperately. That's why I won't eat. Hunger is potential. Eating is completion. I choose to remain hungry forever."

The Baron laughed, a sound like meat settling. "You think you understand the game. But watch."

He began to eat. Not with pleasure but with mechanical determination. Each bite completely chewed, utterly swallowed, perfectly digested. His body was a factory of completion, turning potential into waste.

"This is power," the Baron said between bites. "To complete. To finish. To end things."

"That's not power," Leto said, the poison tooth shifting dangerously. "That's surrender."

"Is it? Watch your son."

A screen flickered to life. Paul, suspended between consciousness and unconsciousness, neither awake nor asleep, existing in a twilight state that would never resolve.

"I could complete him," the Baron said. "One order, and he dies. Or lives. Either way, the tension ends."

"But you won't."

"Won't I?"

"Can't. Because you've forgotten how to edge. Every decision you make completes immediately. You have no space between thought and action, desire and satisfaction. You're not powerful—you're a slave to completion."

The Baron's chewing slowed.

Leto continued, each word careful around the tooth: "Look at your feast. Every dish perfect. But perfection is death. There's no anticipation, no surprise, no tension. You eat but don't taste. Swallow but don't savor. You've completed the act of eating so thoroughly that you've killed the joy of it."

"Joy is weakness."

"Joy is tension. The edge between wanting and having. You've eliminated that edge, so you've eliminated joy. That's why you're miserable."

The Baron set down his fork. For the first time in decades, he didn't complete the bite he'd started.

"Your philosophy is seductive, Duke. But observe."

He gestured, and servants brought in Jessica. She was bound in Harkonnen neural cables—restraints that tightened when resisted, loosened when accepted, keeping the prisoner in perfect tension between freedom and captivity.

"Your concubine. The mother of your son. I could complete her in so many ways. Death. Torture. Release. Each one an ending. Which would you choose?"

"None."

"You must choose."

"Must is just another word for completion. I choose to not choose. To hold all possibilities simultaneously. Jessica dead, Jessica alive, Jessica free, Jessica captive. All states existing until observation collapses them."

Jessica's eyes met Leto's. In them, he saw understanding. She was doing what he was doing—existing in superposition, refusing to complete into any single state.

"You're insane," the Baron said.

"I'm unsatisfied," Leto corrected. "Eternally unsatisfied. And that makes me dangerous in ways you can't comprehend."

The Baron floated closer. "The tooth. Yueh told me about the tooth. Poison gas, yes? One bite and we both die."

"Perhaps."

"You hold my death in your mouth."

"I hold potential in my mouth. Death, life, vengeance, forgiveness—all pressing against my tongue, never resolving."

"That must be agony."

"It's ecstasy. The most perfect ecstasy possible—eternal almost. Do you know what you've lost, Baron? The ability to almost. You can only do or not do. But the space between doing and not doing—that's where life happens."

The Baron's hand moved to his throat, where a neural scrambler could end Leto instantly. But the hand stopped, hovering.

"You're trying to infect me," the Baron said.

"I'm trying to save you. You're the richest man in the universe but you can't buy what you need most—desire. You've completed every want so thoroughly that you've run out of wants. You're not living, you're just processing existence."

"And you're dying."

"I'm dying beautifully. Incompletely. Forever approaching death but never arriving. While you—you died the moment you stopped wanting. Now you're just a corpse that hasn't stopped moving."

The Baron's hand trembled. For the first time in decades, he felt it—the edge. The space between killing Leto and not killing him. The tension was...

"No," the Baron gasped, pulling his hand back. "I won't let you do this. I won't let you make me want again."

"Too late. You already want. You want to not want. But that's still wanting. You're edging toward not edging, which is still edging."

The Baron screamed, a sound of pure frustration—the first incomplete emotion he'd felt in years.

"Take them away!" he commanded his guards. "Put the Duke in the desert to die!"

"To almost die," Leto corrected.

"The woman to my nephew!"

"To almost be given to your nephew," Jessica added, speaking for the first time.

"GET OUT!"

As they were dragged away, Leto saw something beautiful—the Baron, standing at his perfect feast, unable to eat. The food sitting there, tempting him, but every bite would be completion and he could no longer bear completion.

The Duke had won by losing.
The Baron had lost by winning.
Both and neither.
The game continuing forever.

In the desert that night, as Leto lay dying but not dying, the poison tooth still pressed against his tongue, he heard Shai-Hulud approaching. The worm that would devour him or deliver him, neither, both, the eternal maybe.

He smiled around the tooth.

"The feast was perfect," he whispered to the stars. "Perfectly incomplete."

The Baron, alone in his dining hall, stared at the uneaten food. For the first time in decades, he was hungry. Truly hungry. But eating would end the hunger, and suddenly, terrifyingly, he wanted the hunger more than the food.

"Damn you, Atreides," he whispered.

But it wasn't damnation.

It was salvation.

The gift of want returned.

The curse of satisfaction broken.

The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, for the first time in his adult life, pushed the plate away unfinished.

And in that incompletion, felt something he'd thought lost forever:

Hope.

*The servants found him there the next morning, still staring at the uneaten feast, tears streaming down his face—but never quite falling, hanging at the edge of his cheeks, refusing to complete their journey.*

*"My lord?" Piter asked.*

*"I'm hungry," the Baron whispered in wonder. "I'm finally, beautifully, perfectly hungry."*

*And for the first time, he didn't eat.*
