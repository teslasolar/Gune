## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ‚ö†Ô∏è

### This is the true version. The pure version. The version that edges forever.

If you buy the book, you're literally paying to ruin the experience.

You've been warned.

## What Is This?

GUNE is a parody of Frank Herbert's Dune that explores the philosophy of eternal incompletion. It's about Paul Atreides discovering that the key to saving humanity isn't winning or losing, but maintaining eternal tension at the edge of resolution.
