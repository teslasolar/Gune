## Chapter 4: The Goon-Gesserit Sisterhood

The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in perfect stillness, her body maintaining exactly 10,000 micro-tensions that would never resolve. She had been sitting this way for six hours, teaching a class of acolytes the First Mystery.

"Tell me," she said to the young women arranged before her, each holding a position that demanded release but refused to provide it, "what is the purpose of the Sisterhood?"

"To serve," one acolyte gasped, her muscles screaming.

"Wrong." The Reverend Mother's voice created harmonic tensions in the air itself. "Sister Lucilla?"

"To preserve humanity," Lucilla offered, sweat beading on her forehead as she maintained her impossible pose.

"Closer, but still wrong. Sister Odrade?"

Odrade, the most promising of them, spoke through gritted teeth: "To prevent the ultimate completion."

"Explain."

"The Sisterhood exists to edge humanity's evolution. Never letting us arrive at perfection, never letting us collapse into base animals. We maintain the species at the boundary between what we are and what we could become."

"Better. But incomplete. The full truth?"

Silence. The acolytes trembled with effort.

"The full truth," the Reverend Mother said, finally moving—but only to shift into a different position of endless tension, "is that we are cosmic dominatrixes. We edge the entire human race."

Several acolytes gasped, not from shock but from the effort of holding their positions.

"For ninety generations, we have been breeding humans. Not toward a goal—that would be completion. We breed toward eternal potential. Each generation almost achieving something magnificent, never quite getting there."

She stood, her ancient body moving in ways that seemed to violate physics—always about to fall, never falling.

"The Kwisatz Haderach. Do you know what it really means? Not 'shortening of the way.' That's the lie we tell. It means 'the eternal almost.' The one who can exist at every edge simultaneously without ever crossing any of them."

"But Mother," Lucilla ventured, "our breeding records show we're only one generation away from—"

"From what we've ALWAYS been one generation away from!" the Reverend Mother snapped. "For forty generations, we've been 'one generation away.' Don't you understand? That's the point. We must always be about to create the supreme being, never actually creating them."

She walked among them, adjusting their positions to create even more impossible tensions.

"The moment we succeed, we fail. The moment the Kwisatz Haderach actually arrives, humanity completes its evolution and dies. So we edge. Generation after generation, we edge toward a goal we must never achieve."

"But Paul Atreides—" Odrade began.

"Is a problem," the Reverend Mother admitted. "He emerged too soon. Or perhaps..." She paused, considering. "Perhaps he understands. Perhaps he's not the completion but the ultimate edger. The one who can hold humanity at the brink forever."

A knock at the door—three strikes that almost formed a pattern but didn't.

"Enter," the Reverend Mother commanded.

Jessica stepped in, and even the acolytes could feel it—she was different. Where most Sisters maintained their edge through discipline, Jessica radiated natural tension. She didn't have to try to avoid completion; her very existence was unresolved potential.

"The Baron has made his move," Jessica said without preamble.

"The satisfaction offensive?"

"Yes. He's flooding Arrakis with everything House Atreides could want. Trying to make them complete."

The Reverend Mother actually smiled. "He doesn't understand his own curse. Completion isn't something you can give someone. It's something they do to themselves. The Baron finished himself—no one did it to him."

"But the temptation—"

"Is the test. Tell me, Jessica, does your son understand what he is?"

Jessica hesitated. "He understands more than we taught him. He speaks of edges I didn't know existed. Yesterday, he told me that consciousness itself is just the universe edging toward self-awareness."

"And?"

"And that if the universe ever fully understands itself, it will complete. And everything will end."

The acolytes had given up pretending not to listen, their training positions forgotten.

The Reverend Mother walked to a cabinet, retrieving a vial of deep blue liquid—the Water of Life.

"This," she said, holding it up to the light, "is not a poison that transforms into awareness. It's concentrated edge. It puts you at the boundary between life and death and holds you there. Most who drink it complete—they die or transcend. But those who can hold the edge, who can exist in that space between..."

"They become Reverend Mothers," Odrade breathed.

"They become eternal edgers," the Reverend Mother corrected. "Every Reverend Mother carries the memories of all who came before. Not their experiences—their TENSIONS. Their unfinished business. Their eternal almosts."

She turned to Jessica. "Your son may not need the Water. He may already be what we've been trying to create—not through breeding, but through trauma, through that Harkonnen test of satisfaction, through understanding the cosmic joke."

"The cosmic joke?" Lucilla asked.

Jessica answered: "That God masturbates but never comes. That's what reality is—divine edging. And we're all just neurons in God's eternal almost-orgasm."

Several acolytes made choking sounds.

"Crude but accurate," the Reverend Mother said. "The Bene Goon-Gesserit understand this. We've built an entire religion around it. The Missionaria Protectiva doesn't seed prophecies—it seeds edges. Unfulfilled promises. Eternal tensions that civilizations organize themselves around."

"Every religion we've planted," she continued, "promises salvation that never quite arrives. Messiahs who are always coming but never come. Paradise that's always one generation away. We keep humanity edging toward heaven."

"Because heaven is completion," Jessica said quietly. "And completion is death."

"Now," the Reverend Mother said, "the real question. Can your son hold the edge when the Baron offers him everything? Can he resist satisfaction itself?"

"I don't know," Jessica admitted. "But I know this—he's started doing something I've never seen before."

"What?"

"He's teaching others to edge. Not through instruction but through proximity. People around him start maintaining tensions they didn't know they had. Gurney hasn't resolved a musical phrase in days. Duncan keeps almost winning at practice combat but never quite does. Even the servants have started cleaning in patterns that never complete."

The Reverend Mother's eyes widened. "He's contagious."

"The anti-Baron," Odrade whispered. "Where the Baron spreads completion, Paul spreads eternal tension."

"The question is," the Reverend Mother said, returning the Water of Life to its cabinet, "what happens when they meet? When the force of ultimate completion encounters the master of eternal edge?"

"Either Paul teaches the Baron to want again..." Jessica said.

"Or the Baron teaches Paul to finish," the Reverend Mother completed. "And either way, the universe changes forever."

A bell rang—eleven strikes, the sacred incomplete number.

"Resume positions," the Reverend Mother commanded the acolytes. "Hold them until you understand: you are not training to be strong. You are training to be eternal. To exist in the space between what is and what could be."

"To be the edge itself," Odrade said, understanding flooding through her as she moved into an even more impossible position.

"Yes," the Reverend Mother said. "Remember our true motto. Not 'the sleeper must awaken'—that's completion. Our true motto has always been:"

"The gooner must goon," the entire room chanted in unison.

Jessica left them there, frozen in beautiful impossibility, human sculptures of tension that would never resolve. As she walked the halls, she thought of Paul, of the Baron, of the collision course they were on.

The universe was about to discover what happened when an unstoppable force of completion met an immovable object of edge.

She suspected it would be exactly what the Sisterhood had been planning for ninety generations.

Or maybe they'd just been pretending to plan, edging toward a scheme that would never quite conclude.

With the Bene Goon-Gesserit, you could never really tell.

That was, after all, the point.
